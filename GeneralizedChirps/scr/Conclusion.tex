\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sec:Con}
In this report, we generalized the binary Chirp using summation over the binary symmetric matrices. We demonstrate that previous generalized Chirp belong the third level of the hierarchy. However, we showed that this is a apecial case of more generalized definition that we already provided.
