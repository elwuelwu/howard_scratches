# Mathematical scratches for decoding binary chirps

The document matrices.tex contains matrix language research of binary chirps. There are also some Julia and Mathematica code for practical simulation purposes.

## Workflow

Clone the reprository by

```bash
git clone git@github.com:elwuelwu/howard_scratches.git
```

Create your own working branch, push the changes to remote. When the added feature is ready, rebase the branch from master and create a pull request.

## Actions

In the actions-tab, you can see the test results run for the code. Currently it only compiles the LaTeX document and the resulting pdf can be downloaded as an artifact.
